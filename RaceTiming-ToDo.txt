Race Timing Software - ToDo
===========================

Race Entry
----------
- Can we use ngAutocomplete for Club and Team fields?
[- Can we add client side validation?]

Race Timing
-----------
In 2016, a race number was enetered before the runner crossed the finish line, which
lead to the system inserting an estimated finishing position. The space bar was then
hit as the runner crossed the line and so an additional time was added, but with no
runner.

The extra, estimated time can be deleted, but then the system seemed to add another
estimated time to the top of list. Apart from this, the deletion seemed to do the 
right thing and all runner results were shifted up one OK.

This needs fixing. Is it a locking problem?
